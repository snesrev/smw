## About
This is a reverse engineered clone of Super Mario World.

It reimplements all parts of the original game and a bunch of mods added by Lunar Magic. The game is playable from start to end.

You need a copy of the ROM to extract game resources (levels, images). Then once that's done, the ROM is no longer needed.

It uses the PPU and DSP implementation from [LakeSnes](https://github.com/elzo-d/LakeSnes), but with lots of speed optimizations.

When running, it runs an emulated version in the background and compares the ram state every frame. If it detects a mismatch, it saves a snapshot in saves/ and displays a counter on screen counting down from 300. Please submit these bug snapshots on discord so that they can be fixed.

## Building
You must self-build for now. Steps for 64-bit Windows:<br>
(0) Download [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe) and install with "Add to PATH" checked<br>
(1) Click the green button "Code > Download ZIP" on the github page and extract the ZIP<br>
(2) Place your USA rom named smw.sfc in that folder<br>
(3) Download [TCC](https://github.com/FitzRoyX/tinycc/releases/download/tcc_20230519/tcc_20230519.zip) and [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.28.2/SDL2-devel-2.28.2-VC.zip) and extract each ZIP into the "third-party" subfolder<br>
(4) Double click "extract_assets.bat" in the main dir. This will create smw_assets.dat.<br>
(5) Double-click "run_with_tcc.bat" in the main dir. This will create smw.exe and run it.<br>
(6) Configure with smw.ini in a text editor like notepad++<br>

## Usage and controls

The game supports snapshots. The joypad input history is also saved in the snapshot. It's thus possible to replay a playthrough in turbo mode to verify that the game behaves correctly.
